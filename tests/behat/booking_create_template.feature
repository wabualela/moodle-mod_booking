  As a teacher

      | student2 | Student   | 2        | student2@example.com | S2       |
    And the following "courses" exist:

    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |

      | teacher1 | C1     | manager        |
      | student1 | C1     | student        |
    And I clean booking cache
    And the following "mod_booking > pricecategories" exist:
      | ordernum | identifier | name       | defaultvalue | disabled | pricecatsortorder |
      | 1        | default    | Base Price | 70           | 0        | 1                 |
      | 2        | special    | Spec Price | 80           | 0        | 1                 |

    ## Unfortunately, in Moodle 4.3 TinyMCE has misbehavior which cause number of site-wide issues. So - we disable it.
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | config      | value         |
      | texteditors | atto,textarea |
    And I change viewport size to "1366x10000"
